    <h2>Basic info</h2> 
  
   <p>The first thing you need to do is know your dog's breed as all dogs are different sizes, weights, shapes and fluffiness and each needs differnt clothes, just like you and me!. Once you have found your dog's breed you need to see if they like wearing dog clothes.<br> You can find 
      out by, 1) by asking a friend who has the same breed and has tried to get their dog to wear clohes or 2) by buying dog clothes on Amazon. After that you can pick your dog's clothes! </p>

<p> The first thing you need to is measure your dog. In my case my dog is 1 feet long and 1/2 foot wide. <br> This means I need to look for dog clothes that fit my dogs size.<br> Then I need to check if my dog is a boy or a girl (you should know this) then I just order what I want for my dog and then in a couple days time (depending where you are) it should arive! </p>

        There are many reasons you would want your dog to wear clothes:<br> You want them to match your clothes as a fashion statement?<br>  You want your dog to be protected whilst on an adventure so he might wear a reflective jacket or a thermal sweater<br> You might want your dog to be warm whilst going climbing somewhere cold, or if your dog works to help people it could have a life preserver or something to hold medical supplies.

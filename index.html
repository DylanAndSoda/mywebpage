<p>How to pick the perfect clothes for your dog!</p> 
</head>
<p> The first thing you need to is measure your dog in my case my dog is 3 feet long and one foot wide. <br> this means I need to look for dog clothes that fit my dogs size.<br> Then I need to check if my dog is a boy or a girl (you should know this) then I just order what I want for my dog and then in a couple days time (depending where you are) it should arive! </p>
